## Hi there, I'm Irina Pykhova 👋

I worked on ComponentOne development tools for many years, starting as .NET developer and evolving into Program Manager for the entire component suite.

I love writing code, but I also enjoy the challenge of building teams and processes that scale, deliver value, and bring joy to everyone involved.

Always happy to connect with people who share interest in engineering leadership and modern .NET development.
